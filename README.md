## About Us
### What we do, who we serve, and why

We specialize in developing world class trading algorithms.

We speak charts! And love nothing more than brainstorming ideas and discovering new ways of representing price.
Our team has experienced developers and day traders, allowing us to make deep dives into the technical and practical details of trading.

We best serve traders and institutions that bring potentially profitable strategies to the table.
We've found that "starting from scratch" and using Machine Learning techniques on raw price action often leads to unstable and fragile strategies.
This method is known as "data mining". It results in an amalgamation of indicators, signals, etc... that perform poorly in live market conditions.

If you have a following on social media and no product to capitalize your audience, then you'll love working with Moonshot.
Our priority is to instill our values in every person involved, create a proven trading tool, and make you and your clients profits.

Unfortunately, there are many bad actors in the trading space.
The reason that NFTs, pyramid schemes, and other financial scams exist is due to individuals that _choose_ to exploit their own clients.
Moonshot's founders seek to _elevate honest traders_ and help them build products that makes headlines for the _right_ reasons.
